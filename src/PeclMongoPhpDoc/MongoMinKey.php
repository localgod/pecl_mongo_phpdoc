 * MongoMinKey is a special type used by the database that evaluates to less than any other type.

 * Thus, if a query is sorted by a given field in ascending order, any document with a MongoMinKey as its value will be returned first.
 *
 * MongoMinKey has no associated fields, methods, or constants. It is merely the "smallest" thing that can be inserted into the database.
