 * MongoMaxKey is a special type used by the database that evaluates to greater than any other type. 
 * Thus, if a query is sorted by a given field in ascending order, any document with a MongoMaxKey as its value will be returned last.
 * 
 * MongoMaxKey has no associated fields, methods, or constants. It is merely the "largest" thing that can be inserted into the database.
